This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app). It's an expense tracker application that allows users to track and manage their expenses.

## Environment Variables

This application uses environment variables for configuration. Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following variables:

```
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/expense-tracker
```

A `.env.example` file is provided as a template. You can copy this file and rename it to `.env` to get started:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

### Required Environment Variables

- `MONGODB_URI`: MongoDB connection string. Default is `mongodb://localhost:27017/expense-tracker` for local development.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Poppins](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Poppins), a clean and modern sans-serif font.
